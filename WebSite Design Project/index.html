            <h2>The Premier League, also affectionately known as The Premiership, is the pride of football in the United Kingdom. The league is relatively young and was formed in response to the decline of the sport in UK during the 1980s.The establishment of the Premier League meant a historical divide of the top-level division from the Football League. The new league would not be part of the Football League, with traditions going back to the 1880s. Yet, it would continue to be a part of the league system – the worst placed teams in the Premier league would be relegated to the second level and the best placed teams would vice versa be promoted from the second level to Premier League. Football stadiums were being neglected and English football clubs were banned from competition in Europe as a result of the disaster that occurred during the 1985 European Cup Tournament at Heysel Stadium in Brussels. The Football League First Division, which had been the major English football league since 1888, lagged well behind its Italian and Spanish rivals and numerous top English players chose to play abroad.

            Around the early 1990s, things begin to turn around as England successfully reached the semi-finals in the 1990 FIFA World Cup. And Europe’s governing body of football, UEFA, lifted the five year ban on European competitions in that same year. The league has seen an explosion in growth and is currently the most watched sporting league in the world.Premier League is a league with lots of money involved. The television contracts are extremely expensive and result in big revenues for the association and the clubs. The matches are broadcasted in more than 180 countries. The gap of revenues is huge between Premier League and the EFL Championship (within the 15 years following the initiation of Premier League, the collective revenues for the clubs would grow over 1000%)</h2>
